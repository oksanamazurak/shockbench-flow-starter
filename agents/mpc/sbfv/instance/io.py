"""Instance files: canonical JSON, hash, loader and validation (design §2.3; Q70, V20).

The instance hash is the SHA-256 of ``canonical_json(obj)``: ``json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"),
allow_nan=False)`` with floats by ``repr`` (Python's default). It is computed over the *parsed* object, so the file's
whitespace does not matter, but a float must stay a float (``1.0``, never ``1``).

Cross-references inside the file are ids (strings); the loader turns them into the integer codes of design §4.1.

The file format is published as a JSON Schema (draft-07), ``data/instance.schema.json`` (Q95): closed key sets, types,
required keys, vocabularies and the single-value ranges the checks below enforce. The loader validates it right after
the ``schema_version`` check and before its own checks, which stay and keep the rules the schema does not state: across
fields, ids, uniqueness, sums, and finite numbers (JSON Schema admits NaN, infinities and integers beyond a float).
