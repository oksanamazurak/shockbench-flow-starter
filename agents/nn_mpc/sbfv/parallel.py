"""The package's one parallel pattern: an ordered map over joblib workers (design §4.1: every draw is keyed).

Every parallel loop of the package (naive's F_Q replications, the strata harms, the realism measures, the V12 gate's
draws, the evaluation runner's episodes) maps a function of one episode or replication index over a range; the draws
are keyed by (27), so the results do not depend on the worker count or the batching, and ``ordered_map`` returns them
in input order. joblib is imported only when ``n_jobs`` is not 1, so a serial run never loads it (Q94 (c) admits it in
the package). The batching is joblib's own (``Parallel(batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)``, Q95; design §12 rows "joblib
``batch_size``" and "``batch_size`` measured"), chosen by measurement (``scripts/python/evidence/m4_conf_timings.py``,
part B).
