"""The LP baselines' shared core (design §8.2, §6.3; Q17, Q67, Q95; milestone M4, stream "lp-baselines").

The only module under ``src/`` that imports highspy (1.12.0 at githash 755a8e0: the HiGHS release SciPy 1.18.1 vendors,
in highspy's own build, a library apart from SciPy's copy at 4f96ee8; design §6.3 as amended for Q95, §12 "HiGHS
builds (M4 re-gate)"), and only inside the functions that solve: importing the module, the package or an
evidence script's modules never needs it (``tests/test_m2_v12.py`` checks the evidence commands against the package's
module-level imports). ``greedy_lp``, ``mpc_det``, ``mpc_scen`` and ``hindsight_consensus`` solve through it;
the oracle, naive's reset-time flow (22) and every sealed value stay on ``scipy.optimize.linprog`` cold solves
(``oracle.lp``, ``instance.nominal``). Readings of design §12 (rows marked "M4 reading" and the stream's rows):

- **One row table** (V3, "no drift from (51)/(52)"). Every window LP except ``greedy_lp``'s is
  ``oracle.lp.build_lp(rolled_instance(inst, S_t, H_t), window_marks(...))``: zero new row code. S_t is the start
  state rebuilt from the wire observation of week t alone (``observed_start``), weeks renumbered t -> 1; the rolled
  instance is ``dataclasses.replace(inst, T=H_t, initial_state=S_t)`` (a fresh memo; its hash label is the original's,
  so it never reaches ``Env``, a replay of a real trajectory, a seal or Static; V3 compares the content digest, which
  the window marks carry). Backlog B^{t-1} is folded into week-1 demand of backlog sinks, since the builder fixes
  B^0 = 0 (exact for rows "backlog" and "serve" of (20)). WIP in the observation is net of booked scrap, so a window
  carries only fab hits with onset >= t (none under persistence; a scenario's future regional conflicts pass theirs
  through ``rolled_lp(..., fab_hits=)``, since ``build_lp`` scraps the observed initial WIP by ``marks.fab_hits``).
- **Horizon** (Q17, Q67). H_t = min(H, T - t + 1), H in {L, L+4, L+8, max(26, 2L)}; L = the largest, over the chains
  of naive's reset-time plan, of route transits plus fab and OSAT processing (22 on `tiny`; design §12 "Lead time L as
  built"). The terminal value V_H is the builder's own credit (23) at the window end (Q93), so at H_t = T - t + 1 the
  MPC is end-aware by construction; at H_t < T - t + 1 the builder's ``salvage_const`` credits what is still out at
  the window end.
- **Point forecast of ``mpc_det``** (§8.2 "Gate baselines"). The marks at the instant t - 1 persist over the window;
  pending prohibitions take effect from their effective week; h^Q and c^wr follow the persisted war-risk class by the
  marks' own rule (``marks.queue_and_transit``); sigma^scr = 0 and no fab hits; demand is (48) for h = 0..7, then
  the seasonal mean d-bar m^sea(t + h). Under blackout (``graph_now`` null) or a coverage rung (null entries) each
  entry keeps its last observed value, else the nominal instance value (``ObservedGraph``).
- **Action mapping** (``week1_action``). Requests: the week-1 LP columns of the action slots, max(x, 0), slots whose
  own (edge, k) is prohibited this week skipped: observed in ``graph_now.prohibited``, forecast under blackout (§9.3's
  dispatch rule, the first-edge rule ``slot_mask`` stated before Q111; the whole-route ``slot_mask`` of Q111 is not
  read, so the LP's choice to send into a lane whose later edge is prohibited now stands, as before). Tanker releases:
  the laneless LP release on (c, k, e) is sent on the first override slot of (c, k, e) in instance order, every week,
  qty 0 included, so the LP, not the default release, controls the tanker release;
  an override slot whose (out-edge, k) is observed or forecast prohibited this week is not sent (§9.3 would drop it
  as masked, and a dropped override does not switch the default release off), and where no override slot of (c, k)
  can be sent a hold for (c, k) stands for the LP's zero release (a hold is never masked and wins over overrides,
  §3.4 step 2). The release lane is exact when every lane through (c, e) shares the rest of its path, as on `tiny`
  (E1 ends both L0 and L2); tandem lanes (M5) need the slot whose lane matches the LP's downstream column.
  Container releases, lot starts, OSAT starts and the energy split are simulator rules and never sent.
- **highspy model.** Rows [A_ub (-inf, b_ub]; A_eq [b_eq, b_eq]] in column-wise CSC; columns [lb, ub] with inf as
  kHighsInf; the model's constant J terms (``-sum(meta["salvage_const"])``) as the HighsLp offset, so HiGHS's
  objective is the full J of (23) and a relative tolerance is relative to it; options ``HIGHS_OPTIONS`` (dual simplex,
  presolve on). ``threads`` is never set: highspy's scheduler fixes it at highspy's first run in the process (the
  oracle's linprog runs SciPy's copy, whose scheduler is its own). The objective is passed unscaled (V11 on the LP
  baselines is reported, not gated: Q100 (2)).
- **Warm start** (Q95). Cold at reset; from week t - 1's basis after that, weeks shifted by one (the dropped week
  removed, the last week repeated when H is fixed), passed as an alien basis that HiGHS repairs. A warm solve's vertex
  depends on the solve history, so an LP baseline's trajectory is deterministic across processes and workers on one
  platform (V1), not across platforms or on a wire resume, and never a sealed value; a wire resume restarts cold
  (``information.runner`` "Resume"). Every rung attempt runs on a fresh ``Highs`` object, so a solve is a function of
  the model, the options and the basis passed, and an in-process resume from ``LPSession.state`` is bit for bit
  (design §12 "LP sessions as built").
- **Status ladder** (§12 "Solver status on generated omega"). Every solve runs ``LADDER``: warm dual with presolve ->
  presolve off -> ipm with crossover -> primal simplex; if every rung fails the policy plays naive's action from the
  same observation (``internal_fallback``: ``NaivePolicy(fq_quantile, end_aware=True)``), counted in
  ``StepTelemetry.fallback``; no solve is ever zero-filled (§6.3).
- **Lexicographic solve (70)** (``hindsight_consensus``). One call of ``addLinearObjective`` with priority 2 = J and
  priority 1 = w.x, ``blend_multi_objectives`` off, ``abs_tolerance`` kHighsInf and ``rel_tolerance`` 1e-9 set
  explicitly (HiGHS's slack is min(abs, rel |J*|); the defaults -1 enforce nothing): J <= J* + 1e-9 |J*|, the reading
  of (70) that stays feasible where J* < 0 (design §12 M4 row "(70) slack"). Ladder ``LEX_LADDER`` (M5 order, design
  §12 M5 row "Lexicographic ladder order"): two calls by dual (J*, then min w.x s.t. J <= J* + 1e-9 |J*|, warm from
  the kept basis) -> one call -> one call with presolve off -> two calls by ipm -> the stage-1 point (tie-break
  skipped, counted). highspy 1.12 returns no valid basis after a multi-objective run, so a one-call success leaves the
  session's chain empty, while a two-call success keeps its stage-1 basis (design §12 "Lexicographic solve as
  built"); hence two calls first.
